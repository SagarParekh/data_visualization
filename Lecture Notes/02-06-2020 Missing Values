02-06-2020 Missing Values

IF you do not consider missing values you have already started with a wrong assumption

Why do we care?
1. Diagonose the cause of missingness
2. Might affect the estimation

BEfore  you do anything:
1. Step 1: observe the missingness.
		- Completely random: Just throw out the cases
		- Random: create a new variable to model it
		- Not Random: find the cause
2. Step 2: Decide on best analysis strategy to yeild the least biased estimates
		- Deletion
		- Single Imputation
		- Model Based

Types:
1. Listwise Deletion:-
2. Pairwise Deletion:- 
3. Imputation	- mean/mode substitution
				- complete case analysis
				- reduces the variability
				- weakens the covariance and correlation estimation
4. Dummy Variable creation:	- indicator for missing value
							- complete case analysis
							- gives biased results
							-
5. Regression Imputation:	- prediction
							- info from observed data
							- overestimates model fit
							- weakens variation
6. Maximum Lilelihood Imputation:	- produce highest log-likelihood
									- consider observations/ independent variables
									- take into account the info you know so not so biased
									- missing variability so harder to have conclusive result
									- might need adjustments to reduce the bias
